Key blob appended to file:
- 0: campaign-encrypted system secret key 
- 88: operator-encrypted system secret key
- 176: plaintext file public key
- 208: random nonce (8 bytes)
- 216: CRC32(plaintext file public key)
- 220: encryption type from config "et" field
- 224: large file skip count from config "spsize" field
- 228: Salsa20 XOR stream (xor with 0s)? (32-bit)

Not appended:
- 232: Salsa20 key


Salsa20 file key = file shared-secret = Curve25519(file private key, system public key) = Curve25519(file public key, system secret key)

Decrypt methods:
- Decrypt campaign-encrypted system secret key using campaign secret key
- Decrypt operator-encrypted system secret key using operator secret key
- Decrypt the blob in ransom note using REVIL private key (blob in ransomnote encrypted using a hard-coded public_key) -> get the system private key
